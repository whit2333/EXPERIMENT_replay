SIDIS Experiment replay scripts
===============================

This was the `UTIL_SIDS` repository and all files were moved into the `UTIL` 
directory.

Notice that on github, there is an @COMMIT hash after `hallc_replay`. This 
means that specific commit is used. It can be changed by doing the following:

```
cd hallc_replay
git checkout COMMITHASH # or pull master
cd ..
git add hallc_replay
git commit -m "updated the hallc_replay commit used"
```
